This is a project to create a user experience based roguelike game, based on a user's gameplay style. The project should avoid strict classes, archetypes and metagames, and instead focus more on an adaptable stats system that progresses as the game does.

The progression system increases a character's skills in a particular category when the character succeeds at an action in that category.

Stats may be hidden or visible, or visible by option.

Actions are categorized into Actives and Passives.

Example Categories:
Defense   how well a character can deal with being attacked
Attack    how well a character can deal damage
Speed     how quickly a character moves. Dodge and
          intricate task success chance
Strength  Ability to move or break objects
Presence  how other characters perceive this character

The first four categories would be on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 being failing every time, to 100 being succeeding every time.

Presence would be on a scale from 0 to 100, with a normal person starting at 50. Performing unassuming actions would lower the score, while obvious actions will raise it.

Example Actives:
Parry                 Defense
Block                 Defense
Melee Weapon Attack   Attack
Ranged Weapon Attack  Attack
Sneak Attack          Attack
Hide                  Presence
Intimidate            Presence
Dodge                 Speed
Break Object          Strength
Barter                Presence

Example Passives:
Reduce Damage         Defense
Move Speed            Speed
Armor Use             Defense
Shield Use            Defense
Draw Aggression       Presence
Draw Avoidance        Presence

Enemies and other NPC's will have their own preferences against the character, whether they will run or challenge a strong character, whether they prefer someone with low or high presence when trading, etc.

Most NPC's will have randomly generated stats, with some unique NPC's and bosses having fixed stats.
